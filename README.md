# React pitfalls
Collection of react pitfalls as described in react documentation

<br>

## 1 - capitalize component name
React components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they won‚Äôt work!

<br>

## 2 - parentheses after return

Without parentheses, any code on the lines after return [will be ignored](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846283/what-are-the-rules-for-javascripts-automatic-semicolon-insertion-asi)!

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  </div>
);
```

## 3 - don't nest component definitions

Components can render other components, but **you must never nest their definitions**:

```javascript
export default function Gallery() {
  // üî¥ Never define a component inside another component!
  function Profile() {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The snippet above is [very slow and causes bugs](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#different-components-at-the-same-position-reset-state). Instead, define every component at the top level:

```javascript
export default function Gallery() {
  // ...
}

// ‚úÖ Declare components at the top level
function Profile() {
  // ...
}
```

When a child component needs some data from a parent, [pass it by props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) instead of nesting definitions.

## 4 - *aria-** and *data-** keep their dash

For historical reasons, [aria-*](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) and [data-*](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) attributes are written as in HTML with dashes.

<br>


## 5 - camel case for style properties

Inline `style` properties are written in camelCase. For example, HTML `<ul style="background-color: black">` would be written as `<ul style={{ backgroundColor: 'black' }}>` in your component.

## 6 - curly braces in props destructuring

**Don‚Äôt miss the pair of `{` and `}` curlies** inside of `(` and `)` when declaring props:

```javascript
function Avatar({ person, size }) {  // ...}
```

This syntax is called [‚Äúdestructuring‚Äù](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Unpacking_fields_from_objects_passed_as_a_function_parameter) and is equivalent to reading properties from a function parameter:

```javascript
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...}
```

<br>

## 7 - no numbers after `&&`

**Don‚Äôt put numbers on the left side of `&&`.**

To test the condition, JavaScript converts the left side to a boolean automatically. However, if the left side is `0`, then the whole expression gets that value (`0`), and React will happily render `0` rather than nothing.

For example, a common mistake is to write code like `messageCount && <p>New messages</p>`. It‚Äôs easy to assume that it renders nothing when `messageCount` is `0`, but it really renders the `0` itself!

To fix it, make the left side a boolean: `messageCount > 0 && <p>New messages</p>`.

## 8 - explicit return in arrow functions

Arrow functions implicitly return the expression right after `=>`, so you didn‚Äôt need a `return` statement:

```javascript
const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
  <li>...</li> // Implicit return!
);
```

However, **you must write `return` explicitly if your `=>` is followed by a `{` curly brace!**

```javascript
const listItems = chemists.map(person => { // Curly brace
  return <li>...</li>;
});
```

Arrow functions containing `=> {` are said to have a [‚Äúblock body‚Äù.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#function_body) They let you write more than a single line of code, but you _have to_ write a `return` statement yourself. If you forget it, nothing gets returned!
